# Project Nexus: E-Commerce Backend

## Overview: Elevating Your Software Development Journey

This repository is dedicated to Project Nexus, a critical component of the ProDev Backend program designed to showcase advanced capabilities in software development. This E-commerce Backend project is a testament to my growth as a backend developer, demonstrating real-world application building, professional workflows, optimized database designs, caching strategies, and robust authentication practices. It aims to solidify my professional portfolio with an industry-ready project.

## E-Commerce Backend: Real-World Application

This project simulates a real-world development environment, emphasizing scalability, security, and performance. It involves:
- Designing and optimizing relational database schemas.
- Building and documenting APIs for frontend integration.
- Enhancing backend performance through query optimization and indexing.

The focus is on developing a robust backend system to support an e-commerce product catalog, handling product data management, user authentication, and APIs for filtering, sorting, and pagination.

## Project Goals

*   **CRUD APIs:** Build APIs for managing products, categories, and user authentication.
*   **Filtering, Sorting, Pagination:** Implement robust logic for efficient product discovery.
*   **Database Optimization:** Design a high-performance database schema to support seamless queries.

## Technologies Used

*   **Framework:** Django / Django REST Framework (DRF)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (optimized with indexing)
*   **Auth:** JWT (SimpleJWT)
*   **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI

## Key Features

### 1. CRUD Operations

*   Create, read, update, and delete operations for products and categories.
*   User authentication and management features using JWT.

### 2. API Features

*   **Filtering and Sorting:** Allow users to filter products by category and sort by price.
*   **Pagination:** Implement paginated responses for large product datasets.

### 3. API Documentation

*   Use Swagger or Postman to generate API documentation.
*   Publish hosted API docs for easy frontend consumption.

## Implementation Process (Git Commit Workflow)

*   `feat: set up Django project with PostgreSQL`
*   `feat: implement user authentication with JWT`
*   `feat: add product APIs with filtering and pagination`
*   `feat: integrate Swagger documentation for API endpoints`
*   `perf: optimize database queries with indexing`
*   `docs: add API usage instructions in Swagger`

## Submission Details

*   **API Deployment:** Host the API with documentation published (e.g., Swagger or Postman).
